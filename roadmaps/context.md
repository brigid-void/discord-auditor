# [discord-auditor]: Context

Purpose: Empower server owners (and your clients) to automate onboarding, permission checks, and lightweight [security audits] via [discord bot]—fully scriptable.

- Inspired by client requests for “zero-friction” Discord security.
- Prefer [rust] or [python] for bot backend.
- Works well as white-label for client [groups].
